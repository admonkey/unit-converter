**Note** the distinction between a [Megabyte][1] and a [Mebibyte][2].

Your question literally asks how to get the *"megabyte"* format but your example indicates a *mebibyte* format.

I realize a lot has happened since you first posted this question, but as of 2016, even Ubuntu has switched to using the SI unit of measure.

Of course I had never thought of any of this until reading some of the other wonderful answers here which led me to dig deeper, so I have combined much of your work and filled in the gaps where I found them.

* [ZWarren's comment][6] noting small `k` is for kilo while big `K` is for Kelvin
* [SpYk3HH's comment][7] for Yottabyte support
* using full precision 1,048,576 instead of rough 1,048,000
